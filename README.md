# Reddit-Research

These functions were used to aid my research of relivant subreddits during the 2016 residential election. 
The actual research was done in python notebooks seperate from this repo. Unfourtunatly, due to the Corona Virus Pandemic
and commitments to other research projects, these notebooks have not been polished into a presentable piece of work. 
However, the functions in these files constitute a good example of the quality code I am capable of creating.
